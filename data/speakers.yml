  talkDescription: "Rapid development approaches like Agile can be a blessing and a curse for UX practitioners who want to do their best work in the best way. It takes time to fully understand the problems and potential solutions we create for our end-users. However, the time we spend on comprehensive research, design, and development can delay the progress our organizations ultimately make. How do we contribute to the development of good products and solutions without delaying our teams? UX researchers can help be part of that solution. "

  talkTitle: "Next-level Animations and Effects with SVG"
  talkDescription: "It can be a struggle to translate the details of a design vision into the browser. Creating bitmap images, icons, and graphics can be time consuming and result in inconsistency and difficulty with managing updates. Scalable vector graphics (SVGs) might be just what you're looking for. SVGs are now supported on every modern browser and mobile device, and usage is on the upswing, but most people only use them for icons. Most developers and designers don't realize how powerful and useful SVGs are. From scalable images to full-blown web applications, SVGs fit many needs.  In this session: I will discuss the importance of understanding the capabilities of SVGs and how developers and designers can improve the quality of designs created in the browser.  Through an understanding of SVG capabilities you will know how each layer of Illustrator is rendered through SVGs in the browser.  You won't learn about SVG font icons; you WILL learn about how to efficiently export SVGs so your team won't curse your name. With SVGs you can render each design layer directly in the browser.  Apply filters, lighting effects, gaussian blur, and animations, all directly through the use of this file format. Get exactly what you want in the browser. Plus a few of my favorite tips/tricks about SVG elements and attributes. "

Even if you're not, I know you're fast-tracking there as quickly as you can. The problem is, what should you spend your time learning? A javascript framework because your coworker said you should? More jQuery, since your boss is just pushing you to get things done as quickly as possible? Or how to build a table, since that's what you actually wanted to try out this weekend? If you're feeling the stress of wanting to learn it all and not feel guilty on the weekends about your furniture building, you're like me: You're a generalist. And that's okay. It's gonna be fine. We'll go over why being a generalist is actually immensely beneficial, why you shouldn't beat yourself up for it, and how you can get to holistic, beautiful products from lots of places, not just from the latest javascript framework (although learning that's lots of fun too)."

It can be hard to know what kind of research to do when and easy to assume that as designers or developers you'll be able make the best call for your user. However, leaving user research out of your  process leaves room for you to spend time working on a feature that isn't a priority for your target customers or implementing a feature ineffectively.  Come to this session to get an overview of the key goals of user research, the key methodologies that any team member can employ, concrete tips for how to select the best method given your goal, and advice to craft your research plans the best way to get the information you're looking for.

  talkDescription: "Whether or not your team expects its designers to write production code, there are some huge benefits of having more overlap between your team's design and development processes. Thinking about design in a modular, object-oriented way can also dramatically improve the experience felt by your end-user. I'd like to tell you two different tales of working with CSS: One is about a UX team @ Amazon whose designers had never professionally pushed code, but were experiencing pain from the disconnect between the design and development processes. And the other is about a young startup whose developers had done most of the designing and writing of CSS until they hired their first design engineer: Me. We'll explore CSS considerations from both the design and engineering sides of the product spectrum and I'll talk a little about how creating a re-usable pattern library with SASS, OOCSS and BEM conventions can empower any team to smooth out an otherwise bumpy product development cycle. Other super fun CSS things we'll discuss working with: \"media objects\", partials, plug and play animations, & my fave responsive grid system."

  talkDescription: "If you're a designer who wants to code, you can learn a lot from online tutorials, side-projects, and contributing to opensource. However, unless you get to work on something with a significant user base, you're unlikely to get exposed to the experiences that will help you write product-level code. For most designers the best way to learn serious front-end development is on the job. Many companies want to attract designer-coders, but they need to back this up with a culture that embraces them, and supports designers with training, tooling, and documentation. In this talk you'll learn how you and your team can build a designer-friendly coding environment to improve design workflows, team collaboration, and product design decisions."

  talkTitle: "C-Speak: Presenting UX To Deciders"
  talkDescription: "<p>UX has hit puberty. Clients and stakeholders are aware of terms like ecosystems, user journeys, and touch-points, but their understanding of exactly what these things are and how to use them for shaping a meaningful strategy is still fuzzy. Business owners now believe that customer experience is one of the best sources for long-term competitive advantages, but they still struggle to foster and achieve great experiences.</p> <p>The good news is that clients increasing look to UX designers for answers about how our work can bring their business strategy to life. We are in a unique position to help companies evolve their strategy so that every touch-point becomes an opportunity for a great user experience. The catch is that to be successful, we must be fluent in the C-speak, the language of C-level executives and business directors, so we can help them recognize pain points and take the right steps to improving the user experience for their product, service, or brand.</p> <p>There is a more strategic role for designers, but traditional design skills will only get you so far. To get a seat at the table with C-level stakeholders and deciders, you must acquire new communication skills and new know-how. This workshop will cover:</p> <ul><li>C-speak 101 – the language of business strategy</li> <li>What UX can add to the conversation that others can’t</li> <li>5 capabilities to add to your repertoire</li> <li>Techniques for communicating decision makers</li></ul> <p>Designers are not generally taught how to define opportunities in ways that are credible in a business context. By learning to speak the language of C-level executives and senior business managers, we can communicate how all channels and touch-points must work together not just stylistically but with strategic intelligence to create a true and lasting value exchange between businesses and customers.</p>"

Perhaps the most compelling reason: SVG images look sharp at any dimension with tiny file sizes—which is great for making responsive websites responsibly. </p> <p>You’ll also learn how SVG helps make otherwise awkward shapes easy to make, and how to use it to make icons that are more accessible than with any other web-based icon creation technique. You’ll learn how SVG can make customized complex graphics on the fly, create compelling animations and other interactions, and empower some pretty great designerly effects. We’ll end by discovering a cornucopia of SVG source materials that are easy to find and even easier to work with.</p>"

It is the ‘behind the scenes’ story of the real-life challenges faced by Anton and Irene, told in a refreshingly candid manner."

  talkDescription: "<p>People have explored the globe since the beginning of history, and have encountered new languages and methods of communication. The Web has done great things to bring us together across languages and cultures, but that doesn't mean we all understand things the same way, even if we are speaking the same language. This new digital landscape still has much to be explored.</p> <p>In this talk we'll look at the idea of digital fluency and how different levels of understanding can impact experience in ways we might not have considered before. We'll look at some of the psychology behind how fluency influences judgement and perception of digital experiences, and how we can approach experience design to build meaningful connections with the people who use our creations.</p>"

  talkTitle: "More Than UI: How the Brand Plays a Role in the User Experience"
  talkDescription: "<p>For years, branding and user experience design seem to be a discipline mixture more reminiscent of oil and water than peanut butter and jelly. However, the need for companies to communicate their values, messages, personality and products in a multi-channel yet consistent experience makes the line between branding and experience design razor thin. Touching on the intersection of marketing, service design, product design, technology, and customer/user experience, this talk will consider what the UX designer’s role could be within this landscape and whether or not we are (or should be) considering the brand experience in user experience design.</p>"

  talkDescription: "<p>In the early years of the web, there was a lot of variation and experimentation with where to put content on a web page. Then, it seems we all settled into a handful of patterns and stayed there for over a decade. It wasn’t until the arrival of responsive design that new ideas for page layout started appearing. Now with new CSS properties for layout landing in browsers, we may be about to see a bigger renaissance in layout design patterns. How can we better use the space inside the glass rectangle? What layout innovations could help users better find and focus on what they want? Take a walk through where we’ve been, where we might be going, and how we can better design for the true medium at hand. This talk features practical examples of what's newly possible, along with access to a code repo for you to play with later. </p>"

  talkDescription: "<p>This workshop will examine the language, rules and strategies for improving the conversations we have around designs through critique.</p><p>Collaboration requires us to share our work; to communicate our ideas with one another and collect other's thoughts in order to know whether the designs and creations we're producing are meeting the objectives of the project. But often we wrestle with collecting feedback. We get comments that are less then helpful because they seem irrelevant or unclear. Or we find that we're getting feedback and reactions at inopportune times rather than points in the process where they would have been useful in informing design decisions.</p><p>Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have with teammates, whether they be designers, developers, stakeholders or whomever. Designers frequently complain about the quality and uselessness of the feedback they are given, but we rarely take a step back and examine how to collect useful feedback and make our discussions around our designs more productive.</p><p>By taking the time to examine critique and how it fits into the design process and both an activity and an aspect of any communication we can focus our conversations and improve our ability to collaborate.</p><p>Participants in this workshop will explore various aspects of critique and the qualities that lead to strong and weak feedback through presentation materials and a series of hands-on activities. Each person will be provided with takeaways that can immediately be put to work to create a useful, collaborative environment for discussing designs.</p>"

  talkDescription: "<p>Every field has its own form of content specialist—faculty in higher education, surgeons in hospitals, and curators in museums. However, a writer or content strategist may not have the same level of specialty knowledge. How do you make sense of and promote this expert knowledge if you have no background in that subject area, let alone an advanced degree?</p> <p>This session will draw from Amanda’s experience as a web designer and content strategist at the University of Minnesota, one of the country’s largest research institutions. Here you’ll find advice for establishing rapport and getting your work done:</p> <ul> <li>Hear how to build an expert’s trust in your knowledge and skills.</li> <li>Get tips for working with difficult specialist personalities, from the complete technophobe to the extreme early adopter.</li> <li>Learn how to channel your specialist’s expertise into great web content.</li> <li>Share your own questions, triumphs, and war stories.</li> </ul>"

  talkTitle: "The Design in Service Design"
  talkDescription: "<p>Service Design is often, well deserved, praised for its analytical and strategic advantages. But if we forget to acknowledge the most central aspect of the discipline it will loose its true glimmering power. Design as the element of surprise. Service Design is not Design just because we call it Design. We have to nourish it. Because the purpose of Service Design is to result in the delivery of a valuable experience, design must be a process of creating and executing.</p>"

This talk is about how we can think about experiences as environments, made of different modes of information. We'll see some examples of how these modes affect the user experience, and learn a framework for thinking about design problems, regardless of channel, device, or flavor.</p>"

  talkTitle: "Programming Diversity"
  talkDescription: "<p>It's been scientifically proven that more diverse communities and workplaces create better products and the solutions to difficult problems are more complete and diverse themselves. Companies are struggling to find adequate talent. So why do we see so few women, people of color, and LGBTQ people at our events and on the about pages of our websites? Even more curiously, why do 60% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years? Why are fewer women choosing to pursue computer science and related degrees than ever before? Why have stories of active discouragement, dismissal, harassment, or worse become regular news?</p> <p>In this talk we’ll examine the causes behind the lack of diversity in our communities, events, and workplaces. We’ll discuss what we can do as community members, event organizers, and co-workers to not only combat this problem, but to encourage positive change by contributing to an atmosphere of inclusivity.</p> <p>Objectives:</p> <ul> <li>Educate about the lack of diversity and why it is a problem</li> <li>Examine what is contributing to both the pipeline issue as well as attrition</li> <li>Isolate what is and isn't working</li> <li>Inspire direct action by examining our own behavior and learning more about the people around us so we can empathize better</li> </ul>"

Only he can help us lay a foundation for large CSS projects. In this talk, John Long will delve deep into his bag of tricks to share practical advice about structuring your CSS. We'll talk about a number of helpful principles for simplifying your CSS and look at how modular CSS applies within the context of Sass.

She recognized that this skill gap led to hiring companies being unable to hire the talent they needed.</p> <p>Leslie realized that companies needed to hire a specific kind of designer but they could not find the right talent. This lead Leslie to work on design education initiatives such as the development of a holistic curriculum for designers through the The Web Standards Project Education Task Force, the Open Web Education Alliance, and the WE (Web Education) Rock Summit/Tour.</p> <p>After years of service to the University, Leslie understood the constraints of a traditional higher education setting and realized that the constraints were not affording educators the opportunity to adequately prepare their students for a career beyond graduation. This realization inspired her to search for a better way to structure a learning environment to support the needs of students and hiring companies.</p>"

  talkTitle: "Web Governance: Where Strategy Meets Structure"
  talkDescription: "<p>I stop organizational conflict around website development by collaborating to create a web governance framework. I do this in four steps: First, I listen. I visit you and listen to all concerns from all stakeholders. Second, I validate. I write a memo articulating what I saw and heard and what I think your key problems are. This memo is usually five or fewer pages. In my experience, there are really only a few things causing big, pervasive problems. Third, I think. I follow up with stakeholders and brainstorm options for resolving your concerns, giving great consideration to your culture. Fourth, I collaborate. Together, we create a governance framework that will be viable and effective for your organization.</p>"

But if we forget to acknowledge the most central aspect of the discipline it will loose its true glimmering power. Design as the element of surprise. Service Design is not Design just because we call it Design. We have to nourish it. Because the purpose of Service Design is to result in the delivery of a valuable experience, design must be a process of creating and executing.</p>"

It is easy and often important for us to quickly rush through our wireframes and prototypes to meet a client deadline, but as professionals we must not overlook the subtleties that can turn a good experience into a great experience.  This talk is about the little details we see in apps and websites we use every day, but often fail to notice.  We fail to notice them because they provide for a much smoother user experience. You will learn how to design for these experiences even with a tight deadline and within a agile workflow. After this presentation you'll never look at another app or website the same again.</p>"

It is crucial for banks to create an Omin-Channel Experience Strategy in order to survive in the harsh economic climate. User Experience has a major impact on whether a organization is leading or falling behind. New unexpected competitors such as Simple and mBank are raising UX standards and making a big impact on the industry. Considering the rapid pace of change in the technology industry, organizations must not tie their Experience Strategy to specific technologies but instead focus on creating positive experience across all channels and touch points. During this talk we will discuss how to create a holistic financial experience strategy, while thinking about what this means for the future. </p>"

  talkTitle: "Ruby Meets Clojure Flavored Database"
  talkDescription: "<p>Datomic is a new database categorized as NewSQL and was created by Rich Hickey. Everybody knows this big name and thinks of Clojure. It is true Datomic fits well to Clojure programming. However, it is not only for Clojure people. </p> <p>Absolutely, Rubyists can use it. We have Diametric gem (https://github.com/relevance/diametric). Using Diametric, we can dive into Datomic from Ruby, from Rails.</p> <p>On Diametric, Datomic's entity is an ActiveModel compliant. Diametric supports Rails' scaffolding.Its usage might look like Datamapper or MongoDB. Eventually, Diametric’s API design settled in a bit far from Ruby, Rails style. In another word, it is not ORM-like. Even though the API design may puzzle Rubyists, Diametric chose the one to expose Datomic's intrinsic properties. It is to leverage a good side of Datomic for us. I believe the more Rubyists use Diametric, the more they like it.</p> <p>In my talk, I’ll introduce Diametric gem and how to use it as well as why its API design is good for us. Also, I will cover how Ruby helped to integrate Datomic API in Diametric gem.</p>"

  talkTitle: "Putting Flexbox into practice"
  talkDescription: "<p>The Flexible Box Layout module, called &quote;flexbox&quote; for short, is the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3’s wide array of new techniques for creating page layouts. Web developers are itching to use it, and with good reason—flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about crazy percentage grid widths, negative margins, float drop, and all those pesky CSS layout quirks we’ve dealt with for over a decade.</p> <p>It all sounds great, but how do you actually put it to use in the real world—today? In this session, you’ll learn when to use flexbox, what the browser-specific variants are, and how to use it to build responsive multi-column page layouts without the headache. Plus, for those of us who just want to dip a toe in for now, we’ll look at some practical ideas for how to use flexbox as progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>"
