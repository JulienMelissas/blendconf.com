He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success.</p><p>Adam is also a strong proponent of critique, not only in design, but also as a key component of collaboration, learning, and improvement. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.</p>"

    session: 1
    title: "Discussing Design: The Art of Critique"
    desc: "Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have around the ideas and designs we create."
    fullDesc: "<p>This workshop will examine the language, rules and strategies for improving the conversations we have around designs through critique.</p><p>Collaboration requires us to share our work; to communicate our ideas with one another and collect other's thoughts in order to know whether the designs and creations we're producing are meeting the objectives of the project. But often we wrestle with collecting feedback. We get comments that are less then helpful because they seem irrelevant or unclear. Or we find that we're getting feedback and reactions at inopportune times rather than points in the process where they would have been useful in informing design decisions.</p><p>Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have with teammates, whether they be designers, developers, stakeholders or whomever. Designers frequently complain about the quality and uselessness of the feedback they are given, but we rarely take a step back and examine how to collect useful feedback and make our discussions around our designs more productive.</p><p>By taking the time to examine critique and how it fits into the design process and both an activity and an aspect of any communication we can focus our conversations and improve our ability to collaborate.</p><p>Participants in this workshop will explore various aspects of critique and the qualities that lead to strong and weak feedback through presentation materials and a series of hands-on activities. Each person will be provided with takeaways that can immediately be put to work to create a useful, collaborative environment for discussing designs.</p>"

    desc: ~
    fullDesc: "Service Design is often, well deserved, praised for its analytical and strategic advantages. But if we forget to acknowledge the most central aspect of the discipline it will loose its true glimmering power. Design as the element of surprise. Service Design is not Design just because we call it Design. We have to nourish it. Because the purpose of Service Design is to result in the delivery of a valuable experience, design must be a process of creating and executing."

    fullDesc: "Information is tricky stuff. We talk about it a lot, but what do we mean when we do? And how does something so abstract turn into tangible experiences for users? This talk is about how we can think about experiences as environments, made of different modes of information. We'll see some examples of how these modes affect the user experience, and learn a framework for thinking about design problems, regardless of channel, device, or flavor. "

    desc: "In this talk we'll show you how to get off the ⌘+TAB merry go round and roll your own project-specific workspaces in the shell using tmux, Vim, Git, grc, and other open source text mode goodies. You'll spend less time setting up your tools to work and more time actually working."
