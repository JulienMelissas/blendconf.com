        Whether or not your team expects its designers to write production code, there are some huge benefits of having more overlap between your team's design and development processes. Thinking about design in a modular, object-oriented way can also dramatically improve the experience felt by your end-user. I'd like to tell you two different tales of working with CSS: One is about a UX team @ Amazon whose designers had never professionally pushed code, but were experiencing pain from the disconnect between the design and development processes. And the other is about a young startup whose developers had done most of the designing and writing of CSS until they hired their first design engineer: Me. We'll explore CSS considerations from both the design and engineering sides of the product spectrum and I'll talk a little about how creating a re-usable pattern library with SASS, OOCSS and BEM conventions can empower any team to smooth out an otherwise bumpy product development cycle. Other super fun CSS things we'll discuss working with: "media objects", partials, plug and play animations, & my fave responsive grid system.
