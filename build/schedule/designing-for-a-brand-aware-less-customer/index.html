  <title>Designing for a Brand Aware-less Customer with Nora Richardson | Blend Conference: Sept 11-13 in Charlotte, NC</title>
  <meta content=""No one cares about your brand. It is not loved. It is not important. It is not invited anywhere but to your company picnic. That is, unless you can make the brand relevant to people’s lives. To the way they understand things…No one cares about your brand unless you find a way to speak to why you care about it." - Scott Goodson, Author of Uprising  And that is where design comes in.  Most marketers identified brand awareness as a goal. And that is where design comes in.  Most customers don’t feel like marketers understand them. And that is where design comes in. The ultimate purchasers are becoming blind in this noisy marketing world. And that is where design comes in. We as designers need to rethink our world…rethink our purpose…rethink our importance.  Defining Brand Awareness vs Brand Aware-less The Current Problem of Designers How to Reach a Blinded Audience  " name="description" />
