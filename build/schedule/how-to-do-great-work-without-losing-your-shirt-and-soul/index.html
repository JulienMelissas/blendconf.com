        How to Do Great Work Without Losing Your Shirt (and Soul)

        <p>Most of us who are any good at design, development, or UX got into this because we love it, not because we saw dollar signs. We grew up with concert posters, comic books, and t-shirts letting us know that creative is cool, and we'd like to keep it that way. But what happens when you've been at this for a while and you're still making fry cook wages (or so it seems)? Billing hourly, outsourcing, using templates, and all of the other less than exciting parts of the job creep in.</p> <p>So how do you create great work, stay fresh, and avoid starvation all at once? Let's have a chat about real dollars, real projects, and real solutions to figure out how we can do what we love without losing our shirts and souls.</p>

          About Brad Weaver
        </h2>
        Brad Weaver is a Partner & Director of Design at Nine Labs. He designs, he codes, he writes, he UXs, he slices and dices. Brad went to school to be a lawyer, then he came to his senses and has spent the last 15 years as a UX generalist with a geek's heart of gold. His experience includes product development, interactive, branding, and market segmentation. He's been the big cheese, the plebeian, the middle manager, and the class clown. He's also folded clothes, pumped gas, bagged groceries, sold cell phones, and climbed the Great Wall of China. He likes beer, scotch, Oxford commas, and Jesus, but not in that order. He's worked with clients including MTV, Verizon, Bank of America, AT&T, ESPN, Disney, Columbia Records, NATO, SunTrust, The PGA, Olive Garden, Coca-Cola, Big Brothers Big Sisters, United Health Group, The Home Depot, Chick-fil-A, Macy’s, Hard Rock Café, and more.
