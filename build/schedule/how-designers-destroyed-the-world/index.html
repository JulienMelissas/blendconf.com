  <title>How Designers Destroyed the World with Mike Monteiro | Blend Conference: Sept 11-13, 2014 in Charlotte, NC</title>
  <meta content="Designers have a responsibility, not only to themselves and to their clients, but also to the wider world. We are designers because we love to create, but creation without responsibility breeds destruction. Every day, designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This needs to change. In this bluntly honest talk, Mike will invite you to consider your responsibilities as a designer and embrace your role as gatekeeper. You’ll learn how to increase your influence and be moved to use your powers for good." name="description" />

          About Mike Monteiro
        </h2>
        Mike Monteiro is the co-founder and design director of Mule Design, an interactive design studio whose work has been called "delightfully hostile" by the New Yorker.  He prefers elegant, simple sites with clear language that serve a real need. He prefers that designers have strong spines. Mike writes and speaks frequently about the craft and business of design. In early 2011, he gave a CreativeMornings talk entitled "F— You, Pay Me" that uplifted the downtrodden the world over, and he can be heard weekly as the co-host of Let’s Make Mistakes. His book about handling yourself professionally as a designer, Design Is a Job, was published by A Book Apart in 2012, and is being incorporated as a textbook in design programs across the country.
