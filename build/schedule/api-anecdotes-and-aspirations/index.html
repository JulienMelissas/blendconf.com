  <title>API Anecdotes and Aspirations with Jason Hunter | Blend Conference: Sept 11-13 in Charlotte, NC</title>
  <meta content="Everyone loves to hate the decisions other developers make.  We point and gibe with our fellow co-workers at the dumb thing that other guy did, all the while knowing that in all likelihood somebody else is saying the same about us.  This is especially true when it comes to API design.In this talk, I will share some anecdotes about personal experiences I have had while integrating APIs over the past few years and give some tips to help you overcome any premature hair loss when working under similar circumstances.  We will then turn the talk on its head and discuss steps that can be taken to mitigate being on the receiving end of a developer's temper tantrum." name="description" />
