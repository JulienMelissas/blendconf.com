        <p>In order to reach our goals in the upside-down world of graphic design, you need to be a rogue. A misfit. A renegade. James White from the Signalnoise Studio has based his career on doing things outside of the ordinary, turning his back on boardrooms and creative briefs in order to chase his design dreams with vengeance and rock n’ roll. He will be telling his story while discussing personal projects built from love and ambition in his small home office in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. These led to him working with respected people all over the world, from his favourite metal band to film juggernaut Kevin Smith. James will talk about chasing your creative path, building your personal body of work, the value of supporting friends, and never forgetting the artist inside.</p>

        <h2>
          About James White
        </h2>
        <p>James White was born in 1977 and calls Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada his home. His parents were never able to keep typewriter paper in the house as James would steal it for drawings as early as the age of 4. Upon graduation of highschool he attended a Graphic Design course in his hometown where he was introduced to Photoshop and Illustrator, tools he still uses today. His professional design career began in 1998 where he cut his teeth designing websites and print campaigns.</p> <p>James never stopped creating and working on his own projects that took up his evenings and weekends which resulted in the creation of Signalnoise Studio. James’ personal projects gained recognition in the industry and led him to working with Toyota, Universal Music, Nike, MTV, Google, Wired and many other clients.</p> <p>Today James is focusing on the alternative art movie poster industry, creating some pieces to compliment his favorite films. He also spends a lot of time on the road speaking at various design conventions and events around the world.</p>

        Over the years we've looking for sponsors that didn't want to be boring. I think we accomplished that and came up with some pretty interesting ideas. Our sponsors have been the best and we appreciate their support to make BlendConf a success.
