          I'm a Generalist Too, It's Gonna Be Fine

        <p>
          I'm shooting in the dark a little here but I'm guessing that you're really, really good at what you do. Even if you're not, I know you're fast-tracking there as quickly as you can. The problem is, what should you spend your time learning? A javascript framework because your coworker said you should? More jQuery, since your boss is just pushing you to get things done as quickly as possible? Or how to build a table, since that's what you actually wanted to try out this weekend? If you're feeling the stress of wanting to learn it all and not feel guilty on the weekends about your furniture building, you're like me: You're a generalist. And that's okay. It's gonna be fine. We'll go over why being a generalist is actually immensely beneficial, why you shouldn't beat yourself up for it, and how you can get to holistic, beautiful products from lots of places, not just from the latest javascript framework (although learning that's lots of fun too).

        We think sponsorship should be more than just a link and logo on a website.
