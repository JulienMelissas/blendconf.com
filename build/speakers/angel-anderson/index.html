          C-Speak: Presenting UX To Deciders
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>UX has hit puberty. Clients and stakeholders are aware of terms like ecosystems, user journeys, and touch-points, but their understanding of exactly what these things are and how to use them for shaping a meaningful strategy is still fuzzy. Business owners now believe that customer experience is one of the best sources for long-term competitive advantages, but they still struggle to foster and achieve great experiences.</p> <p>The good news is that clients increasing look to UX designers for answers about how our work can bring their business strategy to life. We are in a unique position to help companies evolve their strategy so that every touch-point becomes an opportunity for a great user experience. The catch is that to be successful, we must be fluent in the C-speak, the language of C-level executives and business directors, so we can help them recognize pain points and take the right steps to improving the user experience for their product, service, or brand.</p> <p>There is a more strategic role for designers, but traditional design skills will only get you so far. To get a seat at the table with C-level stakeholders and deciders, you must acquire new communication skills and new know-how. This workshop will cover:</p> <ul><li>C-speak 101 – the language of business strategy</li> <li>What UX can add to the conversation that others can’t</li> <li>5 capabilities to add to your repertoire</li> <li>Techniques for communicating decision makers</li></ul> <p>Designers are not generally taught how to define opportunities in ways that are credible in a business context. By learning to speak the language of C-level executives and senior business managers, we can communicate how all channels and touch-points must work together not just stylistically but with strategic intelligence to create a true and lasting value exchange between businesses and customers.</p>
