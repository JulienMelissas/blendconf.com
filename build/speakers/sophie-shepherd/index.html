          Sophie's Presentation
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Designing for Clients: Working Together For The Health of the Project
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>With sites out there like "Clients From Hell" it can be easy to see clients as our opposition and to forget that they are actually our lifeblood and the sole reason that many designers have been able to make a career out of their passions. In this talk, Sophie will explain the importance of joining forces with clients rather than setting up against them. She will provide tips about educating, selling design, and keeping clients excited about the work at hand.</p>
