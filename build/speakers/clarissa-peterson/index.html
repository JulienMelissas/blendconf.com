          Responsive Typography
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>Your content is the most important feature of your website, so it's important to make sure that the text looks good and is easy to read no matter what device type or screen size it's being viewed on. One size does not fit all when it comes to typography, but you can use media queries to adjust type qualities such as size, line height, column width, margins, hyphenation, and even typeface depending on the viewport size. Learn how you can use CSS to apply design rules that will make your typography look better and perform better across devices. You'll also find out how typography affects the loading time of your website, and what you can do to improve performance.</p>
