          Research in an agile world
        </h3>
        <p>
          Rapid development approaches like Agile can be a blessing and a curse for UX practitioners who want to do their best work in the best way. It takes time to fully understand the problems and potential solutions we create for our end-users. However, the time we spend on comprehensive research, design, and development can delay the progress our organizations ultimately make. How do we contribute to the development of good products and solutions without delaying our teams? UX researchers can help be part of that solution.
